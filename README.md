# Development of Wally Â (V1.0.0)


## Project summary

## MVP
- App back-end application is built with Express and Node
- App front-end application is built with React.
- MongoDB is used as the database management system.
- The back-end and front-end applications implement JWT token-based authentication to sign up, sign in, and sign out users.
- Authorization is implemented across the front-end and back-end. Guest users (those not signed in) should not be able to create, update, or delete data in the application or access functionality allowing those actions.
- The project has at least two data entities in addition to the User model. At least one entity must have a relationship with the User model.
- The project has full CRUD functionality on both the back-end and front-end.
- The front-end application does not hold any secret keys. Public APIs that require secret keys must be accessed from the back-end application.
- The project is deployed online so that the rest of the world can use it.
